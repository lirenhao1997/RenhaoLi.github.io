Hi, I'm Renhao Li (李仁昊).
I am a third-year (2020.09-now) Master in Electronic Information at Sichuan University, and have the fortune to be advised by Prof. Lei Duan. I am also glad to work together with Prof. Min Yang from Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology recently. Before that, I received my bachelor degree of Computer Science and Technology at Sichuan University in 2020.

My primary research interest lies in natural language processing and data mining. Specifically, I have conducted researches on how to generate more expressive and robust semantic representation for natural language understanding tasks such as question answering and semantic textual similarity. In addition to the unstructured text scenario, I am also interested in machine learning algorithms for structured data source such as knowledge graphs and heterogeneous information networks.
